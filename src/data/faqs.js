    question: 'How much does a concrete driveway cost in the Waco area?',
    answer:
      'Standard concrete runs $6-12 per square foot. Stamped or decorative finishes are $12-18 per square foot. A typical two-car driveway (600 sq ft) runs $3,600-$10,800 depending on finish, site prep needs, and access. We provide free, detailed estimates — no surprises.',

    question: 'Why does concrete crack in Central Texas?',
    answer:
      'Two main reasons: our black clay soil expands when wet and shrinks when dry, putting stress on the slab; and summer heat causes rapid curing if not managed. We prevent this with proper base prep, control joints cut at the right spacing, and curing compounds that slow moisture loss.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long before I can drive on my new driveway?',
    answer:
      'Light foot traffic in 24 hours. Vehicles should stay off for 7 days. Full cure strength takes 28 days, but by day 7 the concrete has reached about 70% strength — enough for normal vehicle use. We will give you specific guidance based on your mix and weather conditions.',

    question: 'What areas do you serve?',

      'We work within approximately 50 miles of Waco, including Temple, Killeen, Hewitt, Woodway, Robinson, Lorena, McGregor, and surrounding communities in McLennan, Bell, and Coryell counties.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between stamped and regular concrete?",
    answer:
      'Stamped concrete has patterns pressed into the surface while it is still wet — replicating stone, brick, or slate. It costs 30-50% less than natural stone but requires sealing every 2-3 years. Regular broom-finished concrete is more utilitarian, lower cost, and needs less maintenance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer warranties?',
    answer:
      'We stand behind our work. Structural issues due to our installation are covered for 2 years. Cracking from soil movement — which no contractor can fully control in this area — is not covered, but we design our joints and reinforcement to minimize it. We will explain exactly what to expect before we start.',
