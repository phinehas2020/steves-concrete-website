# Concrete Driveway Cost Factors in Waco, TX

If you are planning a new driveway in Waco, the final price depends on a few big decisions and site conditions. This guide explains what drives cost, how to plan a realistic budget, and when it is smart to repair versus replace.

## 1) Square footage and layout

Larger driveways cost more in total, but the price per square foot often improves as the project size increases. Layout also matters:

- Long straight driveways are efficient to form and finish.
- Curves, turnarounds, and decorative borders add time and materials.
- Steep slopes may require extra grading or drainage work.

## 2) Base prep and soil conditions

Central Texas clay soils can expand and contract. A properly prepared base and correct thickness help prevent early cracking. When the existing base is poor or uneven, additional excavation and compaction are required.

## 3) Finish type

The finish you choose affects both labor time and materials:

- Broom finish is the most budget-friendly and provides good traction.
- Exposed aggregate adds texture and visual interest.
- Stamped patterns and color blends take more time but boost curb appeal.

If you are considering decorative finishes, see our [Stamped Concrete](/services/stamped-concrete) page for options and examples.

## 4) Access and logistics

Narrow gates, steep elevations, or long pump distances can add cost. Clear access helps keep the project efficient.

## 5) Repair vs. replace

If you have a few cracks or surface wear, a repair may be enough. But if the slab is settling, heaving, or breaking apart, replacement is usually the better long-term choice.
