# SEO Sprint Execution — 2026-02-26

## Executed now in codebase
- Expanded keyword tracking asset created: `reports/semrush-keywords-waco-2026-02-26.csv` (98 unique terms).
- Hewitt + Woodway landing-page copy was rewritten for stronger local intent, conversion clarity, and soil-condition relevance.
- Location landing template now includes:
  - Nearby city landing-page links
  - Popular service deep links
  - Additional `LocalBusiness/Contractor` JSON-LD node per location page
- SEO defaults were refreshed and canonical/URL handling normalized in runtime metadata logic.
- Homepage static metadata (`index.html`) was aligned with runtime defaults to avoid message mismatch.
- Homepage hero now includes crawlable city-page links for Woodway, Hewitt, Temple, and Killeen.
- Footer now links to all location pages (not a subset), improving internal-link equity flow.

## What this keyword set targets
- A **98-keyword local commercial set** for `www.concretewaco.com` focused on conversion intent, not informational traffic.
- Coverage is split across four buying-intent buckets:
  1. Core contractor terms by city (Waco, Woodway, Hewitt, Temple, Killeen, Robinson, Lorena, McGregor)
  2. Service + city combinations (driveway, patio, stamped concrete, repair, foundation, slab, commercial)
  3. Near-me + reputation modifiers (best/top rated)
  4. Cost/pricing queries for estimate-ready traffic
- Primary objective: win local pack + organic positions for “ready to call” concrete jobs across Waco and nearby markets.

## Recommended Semrush tags/groups after import
Apply both **Groups** and **Tags** so reporting can be sliced by city, intent, and service line.

**Groups**
- `Core | City Contractors`
- `Service | City`
- `Local Intent | Near Me + Best`
- `Buyer Intent | Cost + Pricing`

**Tags**
- City tags: `city_waco`, `city_woodway`, `city_hewitt`, `city_temple`, `city_killeen`, `city_robinson`, `city_lorena`, `city_mcgregor`
- Intent tags: `intent_core`, `intent_service`, `intent_near_me`, `intent_reputation`, `intent_pricing`
- Service tags: `svc_driveway`, `svc_patio`, `svc_stamped`, `svc_repair`, `svc_foundation`, `svc_slab`, `svc_commercial`

## Priority tiers (execution order)
**P1 (start first):**
- Waco core contractor terms
- Waco service terms (especially driveway, patio, repair, stamped)
- Waco near-me and best/top-rated variants

**P2 (second wave):**
- Woodway + Hewitt service and core terms
- Temple + Killeen service and core terms
- Commercial concrete terms tied to Waco/Temple/Killeen

**P3 (third wave):**
- Robinson, Lorena, and McGregor expansions
- Long-tail pricing variants outside Waco core
- Lower-volume edge variants (e.g., per-square-foot/per-yard phrasing)

## Expected ranking impact timeline
If on-page targeting, internal linking, GBP signals, and review velocity are actively improved in parallel, early movement usually appears in **2-4 weeks** (new impressions and ranking entry), with the strongest gains in **6-10 weeks** for Waco transactional terms. Nearby-city terms typically lag because of weaker geographic relevance and lower entity strength, so expect **8-14 weeks** for stable top-page visibility in Temple/Killeen and outer-ring cities. The set is designed to produce faster wins in Waco first, then compound authority outward.
