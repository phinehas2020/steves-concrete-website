# SEO Keyword Gap Map — Waco Concrete (2026-03-01)

## Objective
Capture high-intent non-brand queries shown in SEMrush Gap (`Weak` + `Missing`) without using competitor branded terms.

## Priority Tiers

### Tier 1: Fast-win weak terms (already ranking, push to top 3)
1. `waco concrete`
2. `waco concrete contractors`
3. `concrete contractors waco tx`
4. `concrete companies waco tx`
5. `concrete waco tx`

### Tier 2: Missing transactional local terms
1. `contractors in waco`
2. `contractors in waco tx`
3. `contractors waco tx`
4. `residential concrete work contractors`
5. `concrete contractors residential`
6. `concrete construction contractors near me`
7. `concrete contractor near me waco`
8. `concrete company near me waco`

### Excluded terms
1. Competitor-branded terms (`gonzalez...` etc.)
2. Broad non-core intent unless qualified (`construction waco`, `construction company waco`)

## Keyword-to-Page Mapping

1. Homepage (`/`)
- Primary: `waco concrete contractors`, `concrete companies waco tx`

- Why: Highest authority page + strongest internal link hub

2. Core service hub (`/services/concrete-contractors`)
- Primary: `concrete contractors waco tx`, `residential concrete work contractors`
- Secondary: `concrete contractors residential`, `concrete contractors near me`

3. Waco location page (`/waco-tx-concrete-contractor`)
- Primary: `contractors in waco tx`, `waco concrete contractors`
- Secondary: `concrete companies waco tx`, `concrete contractor near me waco`
- Why: Geo-focused relevance and local SERP alignment

4. Pricing/support section (`/guides` + homepage pricing module)
- Primary: `concrete quote waco tx`, `concrete estimate waco`
- Why: High conversion intent when users compare bids

## High-Volume Zero-Rank Follow-Up (Applied)

After reviewing a new SEMrush snapshot where top-volume terms still showed rank `0`, we expanded direct targeting for non-brand high-volume terms:

1. `concrete contractors residential` / `residential concrete work contractors`
- Strengthened page targeting on `/residential-concrete-contractor-waco-tx` (title, meta, intro, FAQ).

2. `concrete parking lot contractors` / `parking lot construction companies`
- Strengthened page targeting on `/concrete-parking-lots-waco-tx` (H1/title, meta, intro, FAQ).

3. `foundation repair waco tx`
- Added direct relevance on `/concrete-repair-waco-tx` (meta title/description, intro, section heading, FAQ) while keeping scope framed around concrete slab and flatwork repair.

4. `concrete services in ...`
- Added phrase-level support in homepage/default metadata and core service-hub copy for `concrete services in Waco TX`.

5. Internal-link support (next)
- Add 5-8 new contextual links from `/blog`, `/jobs`, and `/guides` to:
  - `/residential-concrete-contractor-waco-tx`
  - `/concrete-parking-lots-waco-tx`
  - `/concrete-repair-waco-tx`
