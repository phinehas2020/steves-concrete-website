## What Competitors Are Doing Better
- Service-specific pages dominate (driveways, stamped, decorative) vs. generic homepage rankings.
- Cost-focused pages from aggregators rank highly for "driveway" and "stamped" queries.
- Exact-match or partial-match domains appear often (Waco + Concrete + [Company]).
- Strong location signal in titles and H1s ("Waco, TX" in visible headings and metadata).
- Many sites run broad service clusters with dedicated landing pages and FAQs.

## Implications For Concrete Works LLC
- Your strongest chance to beat competitors is via service pages that directly match query intent
  (Driveways, Stamped Concrete, Patios), not just the homepage.
- To compete for "driveway" and "stamped" queries, you need cost-guidance content to beat aggregators.
- For "concrete contractor" terms, local signals and directory presence (GBP, citations) matter heavily.

## Immediate On-Site Fixes Implemented
- Updated service page titles and meta descriptions to include Waco, TX.
- Added local considerations, cost factors, timelines, and service FAQs to service pages.
- Added FAQ schema to service pages for better SERP visibility.

## Next Recommended Actions
1. Publish 2-3 cost/guide pages:
   - "Concrete driveway cost in Waco, TX"
   - "Stamped concrete patterns and pricing in Waco"
   - "Concrete patio pricing and finish options in Waco"
2. Expand gallery entries with project specs (sq ft, finish, neighborhood) to boost local relevance.
3. Optimize Google Business Profile and gather reviews for "concrete contractor Waco" queries.
4. Build local citations (Chamber, local directories) to counter directory dominance.
5. Acquire 3-5 local backlinks from suppliers, builders, or community partners.
